### Backwards Design, Student Learning Outcomes
1. Check out the shortest and sweetest explanation of Backwards Design out there: http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/ 

2. Another short overview: https://citl.indiana.edu/teaching-resources/course-design/backward-course-design/ 

3. On crafting learning outcomes: https://citl.indiana.edu/teaching-resources/course-design/developing-learning-outcomes/ 

4. http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/planning-a-class-with-backward-design/33625 

5. Bloom's Taxonomy: https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/ 

6. Three most important aspects of efficient teaching: http://cgi.stanford.edu/~dept-ctl/tomprof/posting.php?ID=1218 "1) beginning planning with the end in mind by using backward course design, 2) generating criteria or rubrics to describe disciplinary work for students, and 3) embedding “assessment” into assessments"

### Teaching and Learning Centers:

FSU's center is building up but is still in its infancy (or rebirth). (https://teaching.fsu.edu/) So it is worth looking good teaching and learning center resources from other universities that have real support for pedagogy:

### Digital Tools

One practical concern of this class is simply that of knowing what tools and technologies exist and in keeping up with current technologies. This is somewhat independent of thinking and working with pedagogy generally. Instructional technologies would be one term to describe the wide range of technologies and, to a degree, the big business of educational technology. Here our interest is in technologies both broadly (e.g. everything from the computer itself to the project, to the software you use or don't use, to websites designed for education) and technologies that may be common or in use in classrooms or boardrooms outside the university (e.g. K-12 classroom technologies, business technologies).

Starting points for this vast area are many:
    - Keep abreast of new technology with any number of popular general audience publications -- e.g. PCMag, Wired, etc.
    - Keep an eye on instructional technology with specific columns/blogs on education sites like IHE and CHE, e.g. https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning and https://www.chronicle.com/section/Technology/30/?cid=UCHESIDENAV2 
- There are of course publications focused specifically on educational technology. For starters, check out Edtech: https://edtechmagazine.com/

The government is in on it: https://tech.ed.gov/
