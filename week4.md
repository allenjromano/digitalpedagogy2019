Peter Elbow: [http://peterelbow.com/](http://peterelbow.com/); check out the site and especially the handouts and snippets of his writing. You are highly encouraged, at your own pace, to read his books on writing. They will likely help you both with your own writing and with teaching writing in large classes like Hum2020.

### Resources

Obviously, I recommend the work of Peter Elbow and John Warner (among many others) to get started if you want to read more.

Particularly useful for all areas is Purdue's online writing lab: [https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/index.html](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/index.html)

The Writing process, an MIT course: clear and concise: [https://writingprocess.mit.edu/](https://writingprocess.mit.edu/)

Books on writing and good writing are plentiful. Of all of them, every professor will have a few favorites. Mine, for all types of writing, is Stephen King's *On Writing*.
