*Review*
As we add to your store of teaching resources, this week it is time to take a look at a recent site: [Ethical Edtech](https://ethicaledtech.info/wiki/Meta:Welcome_to_Ethical_EdTech). check it out and look in particular at write-ups for various tools related to what we have covered so far. 

Though it is not exactly the same as what we might mean by "hybrid pedagogy" later on, you should know of and check out the journal [Hybrid Pedagogy](https://hybridpedagogy.org/).
