### Description

This course serves multiple purposes. It is...
1. an introduction to pedagogy and the scholarship on pedagogy
2. an introduction to digital pedagogy (its methods, tools, and research)
3. an opportunity to prepare materials and become familiar with content that graduate students will teach in coming semesters. 
4. the required training for graduate students to teach at FSU (i.e. policies, procedures, FSU tools and various other nonsense)

Given the multiple goals that this class must fulfill, the format of the course addresses each of these areas in terms. For each class session, we will devote the first part of each class session to areas 1 and 2. We will devote the second part to goals 3 and 4.

### Assignments
Assignments for each area are listed below

Areas 1 and 2: For pedagogy and digital pedagogy, you will usually be assigned a small amount of reading to prepare before class and a pedagogical task for demo purposes. We will operate more like a workshop than anything else, with the goal of trying out new things in a low stakes environment, getting feedback, and gaining confidence in trying different teaching techniques with the particular subject matter of humanities. 

You will also usually be given some tools to look at, ranging from very basic and everyday technologies to specialized teaching technologies. This kind of activity is meant simply to allow you a) to gain familiarity with the range of digital tools available and b) try out as many of these tools as possible and relevant to your own teaching and work. 

Area 3. To gain familiarity with the content of the Hum 2020 course in particular, we will operate simply as a reading group. You will have the chance to read and discuss the major works in the course. This is meant to serve as a solid backbone for your preparation particularly in teaching your own class as instructor of record. It will also provide the raw content upon which we will apply our various pedagogical techniques.

Area 4. For FSU policies and procedures, our time will vary. You do not need to prepare, in general, for this part of the class. 

### Coursebooks

All course materials will be available online.

To the extent that there is a "textbook", we will make particular use of [Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities](https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/description/) and [Digital Humanities Pedagogy](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=2ahUKEwi-jIHDkqjkAhXMT98KHbJHBM0QFjADegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oapen.org%2Fdownload%3Ftype%3Ddocument%26docid%3D646740&usg=AOvVaw36pWJi9uG9s3QUETdNKNAN) { direct link; will open pdf }. 

### Grading

This is a graduate class. It is expected that all students will attend all classes regularly, come to class well-prepared, and participate fully in all class activities. 
Grades are calculated based on the quality of your work in each of the areas laid out above. This is primarily work in class or presented in class. (Or, put another way, work submitted before class will be primarily for use in class and as part of our in-class work.)
