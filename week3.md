**On technology specifically**

The perils of powerpoint have been well known for a long time: [https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/663](https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/663)

The classic Tufte analysis of how Powerpoint leads to problems when the stakes are real: [https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB)

Optional: check out the Gettysburg Address as powerpoint, [http://norvig.com/Gettysburg/index.htm](http://norvig.com/Gettysburg/index.htm)

**Tools**
Starting with this week, you'll see in the assignment links to lists of tools and software. These are all works in progress and open to your contirbutions. Simply clone the respository for the class, make your modification, and submit a pull request. (We will go over how to do this in class.) 

[Digital Presentation Tools](): These include familiar and unfamiliar presentation tools. Note that, as in everything for this class, you are not limited to what *everyone else* thinks is the de facto tool. Feel free to experiment.

[Classroom Management / Response Tools](): These include a variety of tools, many of which require students to purchase a system in advance of the term. 

*Activity*: 

Using any combination of technologies, prepare 5 minutes worth of presentation/lecture around any aspect of the primary reading for today. You can lecture on the specific text or on any issue related to that text (e.g. cultural context, biography, big ideas, comparison with other texts/art, related art, music, performance). This is simply an exercise in experimenting with technology, gaining comfort speaking in front of people, and getting constructive feedback to help in the classroom.

*Primary Reading / HUM2020 Fodder*
Dante Inferno, second half; [Mandelbaum translation online](https://digitaldante.columbia.edu/dante/divine-comedy/inferno/inferno-1/)
