## Slide Decks
Powerpoint and its clones: LibreOffice, Keynote, etc.

Slides.com: This is based on slidesjs and is fantastically flexible. If you are going to use a slidedeck, I highly recommend slides.com over powerpoint. It is cloud-based, easily embeddable (e.g. in Canvas), and offers sleekness without unnecessary garbage.

Prezi.com: The innovative scrolling and zooming presentation tool

## Things that can be repurposed
[Storymap](); Knightlab's storymap tool can work very well as a presentation tool when you have either a map that you want to zoom across or when you have an image that you want to zoom around (note that using a large image is slightly more difficult to set up.) 

[timelinejs](): Another knightlab tool, timelinejs is easy to use and particular effective for conveying a timeline view of history or helping students visualize artifacts in a timeline. One huge advantage of knightlab tools is that they can easily be embedded in presentation or slide deck software as iframes. 

A word document, a pdf document, a folder full of images.

Tabs in a web browser: Sometimes I simply load up a bunch of browser links and use those. It is faster and easier than trying to create a presentation.
